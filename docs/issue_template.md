### Environment

| Question                  | Answer            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `idoitcli` version        | x.y.z             |

| i-doit version            | x.y.z open/pro    |
| i-doit API add-on version | x.y.z             |


### Server logs

<!--
Please note:

1.  Server logs may help to understand what exactly went wrong.
2.  Problems are often caused not on client but on server-side. 
3.  Anonymize your logs properly. Do not post any passwords/secrets/private data.
4.  Make sure i-doit's own logging and Apache error logging are enabled.
5.  Increase PHP's log level on both client and server-side if necessary.
6.  Paste only excerpts from the logs which seem to be useful for further investigation. 
7.  The following paths to log files are examples and depend on your system environment.
