##  Setup a development environment

If you like to contribute source code, documentation snippets, self-explaining examples or other useful bits, fork this repository, setup the environment and make a pull request.

~~~ {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-cli.git
~~~

If you have a GitHub account create a fork first and then clone the repository.

After that, change to your cloned repository and setup the environment with Composer:

~~~ {.bash}
cd i-doit-cli/
composer install
~~~

Now it is the time to do your stuff. Do not forget to commit your changes. When you are done consider to make a pull requests.

Notice, that any of your contributions merged into this repository will be [licensed under the AGPLv3](LICENSE).


##  Requirements

Developers must meet these requirements:

*   See requirements mentioned in the [documentation](README.md)
*   [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/)
*   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


##  Run it!

To run `idoitcli` you do not need to build a binary first. Just run:

~~~ {.bash}
bin/idoitcli
~~~


##  Add your own command

Each command has its own PHP class located under `src/Command`. There is a dummy class you can use as a skeleton. Copy it:

~~~ {.bash}
cd src/Command/
cp Dummy.php MyCommand.php
~~~

Note, that the file name must be in camel-case and it ends with `.php`.

Edit this file with your favorite editor. The class name must be the same as the file name (without the file extension). The entry point is the public method `execute()`.

Next step is to register your new command. This is done inside `bin/idoitcli.php`. Add something like this:

~~~ {.php}
$app
    ->addCommand(
        'my-command',
        __NAMESPACE__ . '\\Command\\MyCommand',
        'Dummy command to print "Hello, World!"'
    );
~~~

Now you are able to execute your command:

~~~ {.bash}
bin/idoitcli my-command
~~~

Further steps:

*   Add options to your command with `$app->addOption()`
*   Overwrite public method `showUsage()` to print usage with option `--help`
